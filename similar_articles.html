<h4>03.09.2020</h4>
Iceland is three days into its fourth annual 'Plastic-free September' campaign, aimed at getting people to think about plastic in their daily lives and to reduce consumption of single-use plastics.The Icelandic campaign is linked to the global United Nations campaign against plastic pollution, with the ambitious goal of ending the single-use plastic age outright.
Iceland comes out in 16th place on the list of countries recycling the most plastic, with 42.7 percent of its plastic waste registered as going for recycling in 2018. Nevertheless, the country throws away 70 million plastic bags per year and 40 kilogrammes of plastic packaging per person per year, Plastic-free September organisers claim.
Plastic pollution is one of the biggest environmental problems the world faces today. Plastic in the ground, and especially in the world's oceans, damages ecosystems and does not decompose. Instead, it breaks up into smaller and smaller pieces over time, and these toxic microplastics become part of food chains with uncertain long-term consequences.
It is believed at this stage that there will be more plastic than fish in the sea by 2050.
Plastic-free September organisers say they are not expecting miracles and that people should start small, for example by setting five realistic goals each year. That way, they can achieve results without turning life upside down. One method would be to take one room at a time and see what changes can be made to reduce plastic use.
Some helpful tips include: buying a plastic-free washing-up brush, toothpaste tablets, bamboo toothbrushes, and re-usable sandwich bags.
Free plastic bags are already banned in Iceland and the sale of plastic bags will also be banned from next year. By the middle of next year the Icelandic government also plans to ban the sale of single-use plastics such as cottonwool buds, drinking straws, cocktail stirrers, plates, cutlery, cups, and glasses.

<h4>03.07.2020</h4>
The sale of single-use plastic cutlery, plates, straws and cotton wool buds will be banned in Iceland from 3rd July next year. A ban on polystyrene food and drinks containers is also being considered.Changes to the law on sanitation and pollution prevention were passed by Alþingi earlier this week before parliament split for its summer recess. 
As well as cotton buds with plastic rods, plastic cutlery, plates, and straws, it will also be prohibited to sell plastic cocktail stirrers and plastic balloon rods/holders. 
As part of the rule change, food shops, restaurants, and fast food establishments will have to either stop serving food and drink in single-use plastic packaging or start charging for it. 
The only exemption to the single-use plastic rule is items classed as medical equipment. 
A blanket ban on the sale of oxo biodegradable plastics is also part of the new law. Such plastics have become increasingly popular in recent years but are actually harmful to health and the environment, according to the environment ministry. This ‘green’ plastic is a growing problem around the world. 
Finally, it will become compulsory to mark single-use plastics with safe disposal instructions and information on the damage plastic can do if it enters the natural environment. Among the products that will need to bear the new information are wet wipes, several tobacco products, sanitary products, and plastic cups.

<h4>17.08.2020</h4>
The seven people who failed to adhere to ‘heimkomusmitgát’ (homecoming contagion caution) rules and were later diagnosed with COVID-19 have a different strain of the virus than has previously been seen in Iceland. No domestic coronavirus transmissions have so far been traced to the seven people.According to deCODE genetics sequencing, the strain of the virus is one not seen in Iceland before and one that has not so far spread to anybody else in the country. The seven were diagnosed on Friday. It will be easy to trace the infection, if any more cases of the new strain arise in the coming days. 
The seven people were part of a group of 13 that travelled to Iceland from one of the six ‘safe’ countries, but their journey started in a different country. They were asked to shield for five days after arrival and then take a second COVID-19 test. Instead, police had to track some group members down when it became clear they had the virus. They arrived back in Iceland on Thursday. 
According to RÚV sources, the people involved are Romanian and flew to Iceland from a ‘safe’ country, but had not been there for 14 days before travel. A border agent decided to test the group members as part of random sampling and they were instructed to adhere to ‘heimkomusmitgát’ rules and take a second test. Some group members did not shield but were quickly tracked down. Seven of the 13 had COVID-19.
Starting from this Wednesday, the list of six exempt countries will be scrapped and all arriving passengers will be subject to double testing with four or five days' quarantine in between.

<h4>16.08.2020</h4>
Representatives of the State police yesterday had to search for some members of a 13-person group that arrived in Iceland through a ‘safe’ country and did not go into ‘homecoming contagion caution’ as they should have. Testing later confirmed that seven of the 13 are infected with COVID-19. They are now isolating at the address they gave on entry to the country.The group arrived in Iceland on Thursday and border guards decided to call the people for random testing because they were arriving from a ‘safe’ country but had started their journey in a different country. 
Only Icelandic residents arriving in the country from one of the six ‘safe’ countries are exempt from heimkomusmitgát (homecoming contagion caution) and two tests with several days in between. Some of the 13 people in question did not stay at home as they should have done, but they were tracked down quickly. Seven people in the group turned out to be infected. 
The police press officer says the group does not appear to have been in much contact with other people. It seems likely that the seven people represent all the new cases officially registered in Iceland on Saturday. 
The nationality of the people and which countries they travelled from and through has not been made public. It is also not known whether the people broke the rules deliberately or because they did not know any better, having flown in from a ‘safe’ country. 
The new rules coming in on Wednesday will see all arriving passengers subject to the same rules, wherever they are travelling from and wherever their permanent home is. Everybody will be tested at the airport, spend four or five days in home quarantine, and then take a second test. 
Meanwhile, Saturday was the busiest day for arrivals in Iceland since the pandemic began. 5,000 passengers flew into Iceland yesterday, including 2,200 tourists. Seven COVID-19 cases were diagnosed within Iceland yesterday, as stated above, and none were diagnosed in border testing.

<h4>23.07.2020</h4>
A police officer handling emergency calls says he chose his words clumsily when talking to a woman who called 112 out of concern for a man she encountered nearly unconscious on the street earlier this week. The officer asked the caller whether or not the man "looked like a taxpayer".The State police commissioner's office released a statement this afternoon admitting the "clumsy" use of language and clarifying that everybody seeking police assistance has the same right to service and respect.
The woman wrote on social media that she had been walking in central Reykjavík at night when she encountered a man sitting on the pavement, barely conscious. She called the emergency number (112) and was then transferred to a police officer.
She wrote that the officer listened as she explained the man's condition to the best of her ability and then asked whether or not he looked like a taxpayer. She wrote that the question left her speechless and left her wondering if police responses depend on who it is that requires their help.
Following RÚV coverage of the incident, the police decided to investigate the phone call internally, which was possible because emergency calls are recorded.
Today's statement from the police admits that the officer's communication with the caller could have been better. The statement says that the officer's choice of words does not represent his own attitude or that of the police overall towards the people the service exists to protect.
The police officer says he chose his words clumsily while trying to understand the situation and that he absolutely did not mean it negatively. He has realised his mistake and apologises for it fully. The statement is careful to point out that his words are not part of common parlance within the police force and that everybody has the same right to service and respect.
The statement goes on to say that the woman has been contacted directly and that she has been informed of the investigation and the officer's explanation of what happened.

<h4>22.07.2020</h4>
A woman who called 112 last night, concerned for the welfare of a stranger she met on the street, has used social media to criticise the response of the police officer she spoke to on the telephone. The incident is now under internal police investigation.The woman was walking in central Reykjavík when she saw a man sitting on the pavement, seemingly on the edge of consciousness. She called the emergency services and her call was transferred to a police officer. She writes online that after describing the man’s condition as well as she could, the officer asked her whether or not the man looked like a taxpayer. 
She says she was gobsmacked by the question and only afterwards started asking herself what it could have meant: whether the officer was referring to the man’s nationality or his social status. Either way, she now believes the question was prejudiced and indicated that the police response varies depending on who is in need. 
The state police information officer told RÚV today that no formal complaint has been received, but that the case is being looked into. He says it is not yet the right time to comment on the officer’s alleged word choice until the recording of the phone call is analysed better and the case investigated further.

<h4>22.07.2020</h4>
The coastguard and environment agency are currently discussing how to respond to stop a new oil leak from the wreck of the El Grillo tanker on the seabed in Seyðisfjörður, East Iceland. The Umhverfisstofnun (environment agency) team leader says the leak is smaller than those discovered in recent years.Coastguard divers inspected the Second World War wreck on 16th July and confirmed that work this spring to plug a hole in one tank seems to have worked well and no oil is leaking any more. A different tank, located under the ship’s bridge has since started leaking, however.  The higher water temperature in the summer can cause more leaks from the corroding shipwreck, according to Sigurrós Friðriksdóttir from Umhverfisstofnun.
“yeah, it seems to be, at least according to the dive results this spring and the repairs this spring, that that tank appears not to be leaking. But it is coming up now. The water temperature is naturally high and that is usually what causes it to start leaking from El Grillo,” Sigurrós says. 
Is it a big leak compared to others from the stricken tanker? “No, it is not a major leak and we have also been in contact with Seyðisfjörður harbour about it. It is their assessment that there is a lot less oil coming up than there has been in recent years.” 
El Grillo was a British oil tanker. It moored in Seyðisfjörður during the British occupation of Iceland during the Second World War, laden with oil, when it was attacked and sunk by German bombers. It has been causing oil pollution in the fjord ever since, despite several efforts to repair holes.

<h4>21.04.2020</h4>
The government agreed funding at its cabinet meeting on Friday for work to stop the oil leak on El Grillo. The decision came at the request of environment minister Guðmundur Ingi Guðbrandsson and amounts to 38 million krónur to try and cover over the latest hole in the oil tanks on the ship that been on the seabed of Seyðisfjörður in East Iceland since 1944.The British oil transporter El Grillo was sunk in a German air raid on East Iceland in February 1944, during the Second World War. The shipwreck began leaking oil into the sea shortly afterwards and efforts to pump the oil out of the wreck took place in 1952 and 2001. Despite this, El Grillo has been leaking oil into the sea for the entire existence of the Republic of Iceland—though sometimes not very much. 
Last summer, oil became a problem in Seyðisfjörður yet again and research began to find the source of the leak. Coastguard divers identified a hole in the oil tanks as the source of the latest leak. The hole is thought to be new and caused by corrosion. 
Using the newly-approved central government funding, the hole will be filled in in the coming weeks to prevent more oil leaking out. The seal will have a removable cover so that the tank can be pumped out in the future if necessary. 
More oil leaks from El Grillo in the summer when the water is warmer and the wreck expands slightly. The work to seal the hole will therefore be completed before the end of spring. 10-15 tonnes of oil are believed to remain in the ship today.
The British authorities bear responsibility for some 5,000 shipwrecks around the world and have offered advice and consulting services for El Grillo, as well as RSPCA teaching advice for cleaning oiled birds. It remains unclear whether the wreck belongs to Iceland or the United Kingdom, and so there is no direct British involvement in financing the clean-up to date.

The man in his sixties being held in police custody in connection to the deadly 25th June house fire on Bræðraborgarstígur in Reykjavík will remain behind bars until at least 6th August while the investigation continues, Reykjavík District Court has declared.The man has been in custody since 26th June and the court has approved police requests to not release him on the grounds of public interest.  
This is the third approved custodial extension, with the first two being a week at a time. The latest court decision, from late Thursday, is for four weeks. 
A statement from the capital region police earlier this week said the investigation is going well, but no specific details will be made public at this time. 
Three died in the fire and two were injured; including one who remains in intensive care. 
Three people were also arrested, though two of them were quickly released without charge. The third, a man in his sixties who lived in the house that burnt down, was arrested outside the Russian embassy on Garðarstræti shortly after the fire was reported. He was remanded in one week’s custody the day after the blaze, and that period was later extended by a further week, and now by a further four weeks.

<h4>19.05.2020</h4>
Capital region police are starting to fine drivers with studded winter tyres on their cars, starting tomorrow, Wednesday. Drivers are reminded to switch to summer tyres to avoid possible fines.Fines for using studs during the summer were increased significantly in 2018 from 5,000 krónur per wheel up to 20,000 krónur. A driver on studded tyres now could therefore have to pay police an 80,000 krónur fine from tomorrow.
Studded tyres are prohibited between 15th April and 31st October each year, except if ice and snow make them necessary.
While they provide safer driving on ice and snow, studded tyres damage bare asphalt significantly in the spring, summer, and autumn. That damaged asphalt becomes a fine dust that can exacerbate respiratory problems.
While studded tyres have been illegal since 15th April, police never start fining drivers straight away. Now, their grace period is over, however.

Drivers on studs will not be fined just yet, but police ask people to change onto summer tyres as soon as possible.The capital region police posted on social media yesterday asking people who live and work in the capital area to get their tyres swapped over.

“The capital region police have therefore always taken account of such conditions and never started handing out fines as soon as 15th April arrives. That will remain the case this year and drivers can continue to breathe easily for a while longer.” 
Studded tyres provide unmatched grip and driving safety on icy and snowy roads, but the breathing analogy above was probably an unintentional nod to one of the main reasons studded tyres are banned in the summer: they break up asphalt into a fine airborne dust that exacerbates respiratory conditions and adds to air pollution. The damage to road surfaces is also a major component of Iceland’s annual road maintenance budget.

<h4>21.04.2020</h4>
The government agreed funding at its cabinet meeting on Friday for work to stop the oil leak on El Grillo. The decision came at the request of environment minister Guðmundur Ingi Guðbrandsson and amounts to 38 million krónur to try and cover over the latest hole in the oil tanks on the ship that been on the seabed of Seyðisfjörður in East Iceland since 1944.The British oil transporter El Grillo was sunk in a German air raid on East Iceland in February 1944, during the Second World War. The shipwreck began leaking oil into the sea shortly afterwards and efforts to pump the oil out of the wreck took place in 1952 and 2001. Despite this, El Grillo has been leaking oil into the sea for the entire existence of the Republic of Iceland—though sometimes not very much. 
Last summer, oil became a problem in Seyðisfjörður yet again and research began to find the source of the leak. Coastguard divers identified a hole in the oil tanks as the source of the latest leak. The hole is thought to be new and caused by corrosion. 
Using the newly-approved central government funding, the hole will be filled in in the coming weeks to prevent more oil leaking out. The seal will have a removable cover so that the tank can be pumped out in the future if necessary. 
More oil leaks from El Grillo in the summer when the water is warmer and the wreck expands slightly. The work to seal the hole will therefore be completed before the end of spring. 10-15 tonnes of oil are believed to remain in the ship today.
The British authorities bear responsibility for some 5,000 shipwrecks around the world and have offered advice and consulting services for El Grillo, as well as RSPCA teaching advice for cleaning oiled birds. It remains unclear whether the wreck belongs to Iceland or the United Kingdom, and so there is no direct British involvement in financing the clean-up to date.

<h4>22.07.2020</h4>
The coastguard and environment agency are currently discussing how to respond to stop a new oil leak from the wreck of the El Grillo tanker on the seabed in Seyðisfjörður, East Iceland. The Umhverfisstofnun (environment agency) team leader says the leak is smaller than those discovered in recent years.Coastguard divers inspected the Second World War wreck on 16th July and confirmed that work this spring to plug a hole in one tank seems to have worked well and no oil is leaking any more. A different tank, located under the ship’s bridge has since started leaking, however.  The higher water temperature in the summer can cause more leaks from the corroding shipwreck, according to Sigurrós Friðriksdóttir from Umhverfisstofnun.
“yeah, it seems to be, at least according to the dive results this spring and the repairs this spring, that that tank appears not to be leaking. But it is coming up now. The water temperature is naturally high and that is usually what causes it to start leaking from El Grillo,” Sigurrós says. 
Is it a big leak compared to others from the stricken tanker? “No, it is not a major leak and we have also been in contact with Seyðisfjörður harbour about it. It is their assessment that there is a lot less oil coming up than there has been in recent years.” 
El Grillo was a British oil tanker. It moored in Seyðisfjörður during the British occupation of Iceland during the Second World War, laden with oil, when it was attacked and sunk by German bombers. It has been causing oil pollution in the fjord ever since, despite several efforts to repair holes.

<h4>19.05.2020</h4>
Capital region police are starting to fine drivers with studded winter tyres on their cars, starting tomorrow, Wednesday. Drivers are reminded to switch to summer tyres to avoid possible fines.Fines for using studs during the summer were increased significantly in 2018 from 5,000 krónur per wheel up to 20,000 krónur. A driver on studded tyres now could therefore have to pay police an 80,000 krónur fine from tomorrow.
Studded tyres are prohibited between 15th April and 31st October each year, except if ice and snow make them necessary.
While they provide safer driving on ice and snow, studded tyres damage bare asphalt significantly in the spring, summer, and autumn. That damaged asphalt becomes a fine dust that can exacerbate respiratory problems.
While studded tyres have been illegal since 15th April, police never start fining drivers straight away. Now, their grace period is over, however.

<h4>26.03.2020</h4>
Rabbit haemorrhagic disease is the likeliest cause of the spate of rabbit deaths in Reykjavík’s Elliðaárdalur recreation and nature reserve area over the past week, according to initial test results.Samples were taken from rabbit carcasses by scientists at MAST (the Food and Veterinary Authority) and tested at the University of Iceland’s Keldur laboratories. If true, it would be the first wild outbreak of the virus in Iceland. Over 50 dead rabbits have been found in Elliðaárdalur valley. 
Rabbit haemorrhagic disease is extremely serious and very often fatal. It affected rabbits on farms and in people’s homes in south and southwest Iceland in 2002. Infection control then prevented the disease spreading further afield and to rabbits living wild. 
Rabbit owners are asked to do some research into the virus so that they can understand how it spreads and protect their own rabbits from infection. The virus is only dangerous to rabbits and does not infect other animals, including humans. 
The virus is transmitted through physical contact between rabbits, rabbit carcasses, or contact with infected surfaces including food, earth, and water. Other animals are not infected by the virus but can easily carry it on their hair, skin, clothes, or shoes. 
Rabbits that catch the disease but make a recovery can remain infectious for a long time after returning to normal health, according to the MAST website.

<h4>25.03.2020</h4>
MAST, the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority is working with the University of Iceland’s Keldur laboratories to try and find out why a large number of rabbits have become sick and died in Reykjavík’s Elliðaárdalur outdoor recreation and nature reserve area.Over 50 dead rabbits have been discovered and removed from the valley in recent days. The main options under investigation are that the deaths are caused either by poisoning or a sudden deadly virus outbreak. People are advised not to take sick rabbits home with them, as that could cause any contagion to spread. 
According to MAST, there is no evidence the rabbits’ death was caused by rat or mouse poison, antifreeze or road salt. There are two main viruses that can cause rabbits to die quickly: rabbit haemorrhagic disease and myxomatosis.  
Rabbit haemorrhagic disease has once before been found in Iceland when there was an outbreak in the south and southwest of the country in 2002. That outbreak killed a large number of rabbits on farms and in people’s homes before it was brought under control. Infected rabbits usually die in less than a day, and within two days if infected with myxomatosis. 
Both viruses affect only rabbits and are not a danger to people or any other animals. 
MAST calls upon people with pet rabbits to avoid visiting Elliðaárdalur for as long as the cause of the rabbit deaths remains unclear. The viruses can live a long time in the environment around infected rabbits and it is very easy for people to bring them home on their clothes and shoes. Rabbit owners who have recently visited the area are advised to was their clothes at at-least 50°C and to clean their shoes in a 1:10 ratio bleach mix. It is unlikely that soap and hand sanitiser are sufficient to kill these rabbit viruses. 
Both viruses are considered virtually incurable and people should therefore not take infected rabbits home with them, according to MAST. City of Reykjavík workers are bringing sick rabbits to vets and safely removing carcasses.
